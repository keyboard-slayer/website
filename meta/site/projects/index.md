# My projects

In this page you can find a non-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on. Some of them are personal projects, others are professional projects. I have also contributed to open-source projects.

- [**A new sandbox for Odoo**](/projects/safe_eval): A drop-in replacement for Odoo's `safe_eval` function that adds some security measures to prevent malicious code execution.
